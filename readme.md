I'm a recent graduate [April 2023] in computer science from the University of Michigan. I've been learning to program for a couple of years, taking on various web / app development roles along the way (most recent highest):

* 💜 [PixieBrix](https://www.pixiebrix.com/)
* 🌐 [Amazon](https://amazon.com)
* 🏥 [Humana](https://humana.com)
* 💊 [Acuitii](https://www.acuitii.life/app)

Between May and August of this year, I'll be backpacking somewhere in Europe. I can't wait to share once I get back!
